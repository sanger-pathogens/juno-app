The JUNO project is named after the ancient Roman goddess whose main duty was to ensure the safety of women and infants in childbirth. The aim of JUNO is to perform a global genomic survey of *Streptococcus agalactiae*, a major cause of neonatal invasive disease worldwide. The produced data will be applied to inform disease intervention strategies.
