#### Our Aim

We will conduct a whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of GBS isolates from across a broad geographical and temporal span with the central aim of informing disease prevention. WGS data offers a direct route to capturing genetic diversity of GBS and allows analyses which can be used to support vaccine design and development. These data and analysis outputs will be disseminated to key stakeholders and made freely available through open online platforms. We will offer bioinformatics training and support to project partners to promote *in situ* genomic analysis of region-specific datasets. This project will be an international effort that will require the generous participation of a diverse group of collaborators from around the world to ensure a high-quality outcome.
